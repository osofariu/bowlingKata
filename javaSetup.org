#+TITLE: Java Setup
* Java environment Setup

I created these instrunctions for setting up a development environment with the latest
versions of Java and gradle.    If you pull this project you can build and execute tests using the
wrapper at the top-level of this project.  That's why the steps to install homebrew and
gradle are optional.

On the other hand having homebrew gives you many other useful things, so it's good to have.

** Install Java 17 (latest)
#+begin_src shell
brew update && brew install java
sudo ln -sfn /Users/ovidiu.sofariu/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
#+end_src

** Install Homebrew (optionally)
Visit: https://brew.sh

#+begin_src shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#+end_src

** Install gradle (optionally)
It pulls in lots of things..

#+begin_src shell
brew install gradle
#+end_src

** Setup project
#+begin_src shell
mkdir bowling
cd bowling
gradle init
# 2: application
# 3: Java
# 1: no sub-projects
# 1: groovy DSL
# no (default) for new APIs
# 4: JUnit Jupiter
# project name: bowling
#+end_src
